[Konshuu](https://konshuu.com/) is a todo tracker focusing on your work and personal tasks a week at a time, allowing you to keep productive momentum by scheduling things for specific days instead of always picking from a single endless todo list.

## Why "Konshuu"?

It's the Japanese word 今週, which means "this week".
